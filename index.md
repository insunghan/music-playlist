# 🎵 Music Playlist Curation Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a passionate music listener and playlist curator.  
Over the years, I've created and organized dozens of playlists across platforms like **Bugs Music**, **YouTube**, and **Spotify**, carefully curated by mood, genre, and theme.  
This portfolio shares a few highlights from my work.

## ✉️ Why This Portfolio?

Music is more than a hobby—it's a way of organizing emotion, memory, and identity.  
As a playlist curator, I combine my love for listening with structured thinking and pattern recognition.  
That's why I’d love to bring this passion to Spotify—where great tech meets the love of sound.
