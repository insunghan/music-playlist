# ðŸŽµ Music Playlist Curation Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a backend engineer with a deep passion for music and music discovery.  
Alongside my technical career, I've curated and organized over 90 playlists across **Bugs Music**, **YouTube**, and **Spotify**â€”carefully structured by mood, genre, and context.

This portfolio showcases a few examples of how I blend listening, categorization, and content structuring.
